A design of 1-3 smart viscoelastic composite (SVC) is proposed for the augmentation of unconstrained/
constrained layer damping treatment of beam. The 1-3 SVC is designed by inserting the active
piezoelectric patches in monolithic viscoelastic material (VEM) layer. The optimal geometrical properties
of the 1-3 SVC layer are decided to maximize the modal loss factor using an exhaustive search method.

1. Introduction
Viscoelastic material (VEM) consists of both viscous and elastic
properties and generally used to dissipate energy in structural
vibration. These viscoelastic materials are used in the form of a
layer that is freely attached to the surface of the host structure
named as unconstrained layer damping (UCLD) treatment or constrained between the surface of the host structure and constraining
layer named as constrained layer damping (CLD) treatment. In
UCLD treatment, energy dissipation occurs due to in-plane extension and compression strain/deformation whereas in CLD treatment, energy dissipation is due to transverse shear strain/
deformation. CLD treatment is also called a passive constrained
layer damping (PCLD) treatment when the constraining layer is a
passive layer. These damping treatments are generally used in
automobiles, aerospace, marine application to reduce the vibration. The UCLD treatment was firstly proposed by Oberst and
Frankenfeld [1]. Later, Ungar and Kerwin [2] analysed the dissipated energy from a plate integrated with the viscoelastic layer.
It has been observed that damping increases through the optimal
distribution of viscoelastic material over the structure as compared
to fully treated UCLD treatment [3,4]. However, damping due to
UCLD treatment is less as compared to CLD treatment [5]. CLD/
PCLD treatment was first introduced in British patent [6]. Kerwin
[7] studied the effect of CLD treatment in structural vibration. Alam
and Asnani [8] observed that damping could be improved using
multiple CLD layers. Whittier [9] introduce the standoff/spacer
layer in between the host structure and damping layer and
observed that damping increase due to an increase in shear deformation of the overall structure. Marcelin et al. [10] proposed the
partial treatment of structure and observed that the optimum size
and location of partial CLD segments can improve damping compared to fully CLD treatment.
Recently, Kumar et al. [11] proposed the design of 1-3 viscoelastic composite (VEC) and utilized it as the damping layer in the
enhancement of UCLD/CLD treatment of the structure. In this
design of 1-3 VEC, the graphite wafers are inserted within the
monolithic VEM layer so in-plane and transverse shear strains in
VEM improves the damping of overall structure. If active piezoelectric patches are used in the place of graphite wafers within the
monolithic VEM layer, the damping may be improved due to the
further enhancement of in-plane extension and transverse shear
strain through the extension actuation of active piezoelectric
patches. Hence, in the present work a design of 1-3 smart viscoelastic composite (SVC) layer is proposed for the augmentation
of UCLD/CLD treatment in the structural vibration. The present
1-3 SVC layer is designed as shown in Fig. 1(a). And, to investigate
the aforesaid effect of present 1-3 SVC layer, first, the optimal geometrical properties of 1-3 SVC layer for UCLD/CLD treatment of
beam are decided based on modal loss factor (1) at different
control-gains (kd). The extension (ge) and shear (gs) counterpart

corresponding variation of the control voltage is also studied to
investigate the damping performance of present 1-3 SVC layer as
compared to the monolithic VEM layer in UCLD/CLD treatment of
beam.
2. Finite element formulation of the overall beam
The schematic diagram of the overall beam is shown in Fig. 1(b)
and (c) where the bottom surface of the beam is considered as the
reference plane and the origin (o) of the reference Cartesian coordinate system (xyz) is located at one edge of this reference plane.
The length, width and thickness of the substrate beam are denoted
by L, b and h respectively. In the case of UCLD treatment, the thickness of the unconstrained 1-3 SVC layer is denoted by hd while in
CLD treatment the thickness of constrained 1-3 SVC and passive
constraining layer are denoted as hd and hc respectively. The thickness of VEM layers, the gap between the active piezoelectric
patches and the number of patches within 1-3 SVC layer are symbolized by hv , Dp and np, respectively (Fig. 1(a)). The edges of the
overall beam are considered as fixed ends while it (beam) is subjected to a transverse point load (p0). The FE model of the overall
beam is derived according to the plane stress assumption [12] in
the y-direction and considering a typical xz-plane as shown in
Fig. 1(b) and (c). Accordingly, the state of strain (e) and the state
of stress (r) at any point within thexz-plane can be written as,
e ¼ ex ez c f g xz
T
; r ¼ f g rx rz sxz
T ð1Þ
where, ex=rx and ez=rzare the normal strain/stress along the x and z
directions, respectively; cxz=sxz is the shear strain/stress in the
xz-plane. The linear strain–displacement relations at any point
can be expressed as,
e ¼ Ld; d ¼ f g u w T
; L ¼ @=@x 0 @=@z
0 @=@z @=@x
 T

where,u and w are the displacements at any point within the overall
beam along x and z directions, respectively; d is the displacement
vector. The constitutive relation for the isotropic layer can be written as,

Although, active piezoelectric patches are used within 1-3 SVC.
These piezoelectric patches are activated by applying the constant

In order to derive the FE model of the overall beam, the xz-plane
(Fig. 1(b)) is discretized by nine-node isoparametric elements. The
displacement vector (d) at a point within a typical element can be
expressed by the elemental nodal displacement vector (de
) and the
shape function matrix (N) as,

The governing equations of motion of the overall beam are
derived by employing extended Hamilton’s principle as given in
Eq. (6). Using Eqs. (3) and (4) in Eqs. (5a) and (5b), and substituting
the resulting equations in Eq. (6), the elemental FE equations of
motion can be obtained as given in Eq. (7).

2.1. Estimation of damping in the overall beam
For the free vibration of the overall beam (p0 ¼0), Eq. (10) can
be expressed as complex quadratic eigenvalue problem as [13],
KR
b þ KR
s
  þ j KI
b þ KI
s þ xC
D E   wi ¼ x2
i Mwi ð11Þ
where, superscript R and Iare the real and imaginary counterpart of
bending and shear global stiffness matrix, wi is the complex nodal
displacement vector of i
th natural mode having the complex natural
frequency of xi. This complex natural frequency can be expressed
in terms of the natural frequency (xo
i ) of the overall beam and
the modal loss factor (gi
) as follows [14],
ð Þ xi
2 ¼ xo
i
 2 1 þ jgi h i; gi ¼ Imð Þ xi
2
=Reð Þ xi
2 ð12Þ
Now, for the assumption of, KI
s ¼ 0 (KI
b–0) and KI
b ¼ 0 (KI
s–0),
the damping in overall beam appears due to in-plane extension/-
compression and transverse shear strains, respectively. The corresponding extensional and shear modal loss factor is denoted by ge
and gs, respectively. Without any assumptions (KI
b–0,KI
s–0), the
modal loss factor (g) indicates total damping in the overall beam.
In order to determine these modal loss factors (ge,gs,g), the complex quadratic eigenvalue problem (Eq. (11)) is presently solved
using direct iteration method as follows,
KR

s

b þ KI

 2
Mwi ð13Þ
In Eq. (13), the superscripts prev and curr indicate the values of
xi corresponding to the previous and current iterations, respectively. The iteration starts with xprev i ¼ 0. In every iteration, a complex linear eigenvalue problem is solved for xcurr
i with an assigned
value of xprev i obtained from the previous iteration. If the value of
xcurr
i appears in good agreement with the value of xprev i according
to convergence criteria, the iteration is terminated with the solution as, xcurr
i ¼ xprev i ¼ xi.
3. Numerical results and discussion
In the present work, the design of 1-3 SVC layer is proposed for
the augmentation of damping in structural vibration. The 1-3 SVC
layer is formed by inserting active piezoelectric patches within the
VEM layer (Fig. 1(a)). So the damping characteristics of 1-3 SVC
layer in UCLD and CLD treatment of the beam are studied. The geometric properties of the substrate beam are considered as, length
L ¼ 0.2 m, width b ¼4 mm and thickness h ¼5 mm. In the case of
UCLD treatment, the thickness of the unconstrained 1-3 SVC layer
is considered as hd ¼1 mm while in CLD treatment the thickness of
constrained 1-3 SVC and passive constraining layer are considered
as hd ¼1 mm and hc ¼0.5 mm respectively. The ends of the overall
beam are considered as fixed ends (uj
x¼0 ¼ 0; uj
x¼L ¼ 0;
wj
x¼0 ¼ 0; wj
x¼L ¼ 0). The substrate beam is made of Aluminium
(E ¼69 GPa, m ¼0.3, q ¼2740 kg/m3
). The active piezoelectric
patches within VEM are made of PZT-5H (C11 ¼151 GPa, C12 ¼98

VEM phase is considered as Butyl Rubber (E ¼15(1 + 0.6i) MPa,
m ¼0.49, q ¼920 kg/m3
). The passive constraining layer is also
made of Aluminium in the CLD treatment. In order to verify the
present FE formulation, the fundamental frequency and corresponding modal loss factor of the overall beam are illustrated in
Table 1 for UCLD and CLD treatments and compared with the similar results available in [4] and [16], respectively. It may be
observed from Table 1 that the present results are in good agreement with the reference results in [4,16]. Similarly, for the validation of the electro-elastic coupling, the dimensionless transverse
displacement of the overall beam is evaluated for an applied external voltage across the thickness of the piezoelectric layer and compared with the similar results available in [17]. It may be observed
from Table 2 that the present FE results are in good agreement
with the available results.
3.1. UCLD treatment of beam with unconstrained 1-3 SVC layer
In order to investigate the effect of 1-3 SVC layer, the damping
characteristics of the beam with unconstrained 1-3 SVC layer are
studied. Since the damping depends on the geometrical properties
(hv ,np, Dp) of 1-3 SVC layer (Fig. 1(a)), the optimal configuration of
the unconstrained 1-3 SVC layer is decided to maximize the modal
loss factor (g) of the overall beam corresponding to the first bending mode of vibration. The exhaustive search method [18] is used
to find the optimal geometrical properties (hv ,np, Dp) of 1-3 SVC
layer. Based on a fabrication point of view, the bounds of the geometrical properties are considered as, 20 m 6 hv 6100 m,
46 np 620, 50 m 6 Dp 6200 m. A three-dimensional contour
shown in Fig. 2 to express the variation of modal loss factor (kd)
with respect to the geometrical properties (hv ,np, Dp) at different
control-gains (kd). The optimal geometrical properties of the
unconstrained 1-3 SVC layer at different control-gains (kd) may
be obtained from Fig. 2 with an intent to maximize the modal loss
factor (g) of the overall beam. These optimal geometrical properties of unconstrained 1-3 SVC layer at different control-gains (kd)
are presented in Table 3. With these optimal geometrical properties of unconstrained 1-3 SVC layer at different control-gains (kd)
(Table 3), the fundamental frequency (xn) and corresponding
modal loss factor (g) and it’s extensional (ge) and shear (gs) counterparts are illustrated in Table 4. The similar results for the beam
with unconstrained monolithic VEM also evaluated (Table 4). It
may be observed from Table 3 that the modal loss factor (g) and
its counterparts (ge,gs) of the beam with unconstrained 1-3 SVC
layer is greater than monolithic VEM layer. The increase in modal
loss factor (g) is due to the combined effect of an increase in extensional (ge) and shear (gs) counterparts. This may be due to an
enhancement of extension/compression and shear strains through
the inserted active piezoelectric patches in VEM layer. The increment in the value of extension counterpart (ge) may be due to an

increase in extension/compression strain of VEM between two
consecutive active piezoelectric patches. However, the increment
in shear counterpart (gs) is due to an increase in shear strain of
top and bottom VEM layers. It may also be observed from the
Table 4 that in case of beam with unconstrained 1-3 SVC layer,
the value of modal loss factor (g) and its extensional (ge) and shear
(gs) counterparts also increases with control-gain (kd). Thus
enhancement in damping (modal loss factor) occurs due to both

layers, respectively.
In order to study the effectiveness of 1-3 SVC, the frequency
responses of the beam with unconstrained 1-3 SVC layer under
transverse point-load (p0 ¼0.04 N) and at different control-gain
(kd) are evaluated around the fundamental frequency (xn). Similar
responses for the beam with unconstrained monolithic VEM are
also evaluated. Fig. 3(a) and (b) illustrate the frequency responses
and corresponding variations of the control voltage of the overall
beam. It may be observed from Fig. 3(a) and (b) that attenuation
increases with the control-gain (kd) while corresponding maximum control-voltage also increases. It may also be noticed that
attenuation improves in case of the beam with unconstrained 1-
3 SVC layer as compared monolithic VEM layer. These results indicate that the damping capability may be improved significantly
using unconstrained 1-3 SVC in the place of monolithic VEM.
3.2. CLD treatment of beam with constrained 1-3 SVC layer
In the present section, the damping characteristics of the beam
with constrained 1-3 SVC are studied. Since the damping depends
on the geometrical properties (hv ,np, Dp) of 1-3 SVC layer (Fig. 1(a)),
the optimal configuration of the constrained 1-3 SVC layer is
decided to maximize the fundamental modal loss factor (g) of
the overall beam similar to aforesaid in Section 3.1. The values of
modal loss factor (g) corresponding to geometrical properties
(hv ,np, Dp) within bounds (20 m 6 hv 6100 m, 46 np 620, 50 m
6 Dp 6200 m) at different control-gains (kd) are illustrated in a
three-dimensional contour as shown in Fig. 4. The optimal geometrical properties of constrained 1-3 SVC layer at different controlgains (kd) may be obtained from Fig. 4 with an intent to maximize
the modal loss factor (g) of the overall beam. These optimal geometrical properties of constrained 1-3 SVC layer at different
control-gains (kd) are presented in Table 5. With these optimal geometrical properties of constrained 1-3 SVC layer at different
control-gains (kd) (Table 5), the fundamental frequency (xn) and
corresponding modal loss factor (g) and it’s extensional (ge) and
shear (gs) counterparts are illustrated in Table 6. The similar
results for the beam with constrained monolithic VEM also evaluated (Table 6). It may be observed from Table 6 that the modal loss
factor (g) and its counterparts (ge,gs) of the beam with constrained
1-3 SVC layer is greater as compared to the monolithic VEM layer.
The increase in modal loss factor (g) is due to the combined effect
of an increase in extensional (ge) and shear (gs) counterparts. This
may be due to an enhancement of extension/compression and
shear strains through the inserted active piezoelectric patches in
VEM layer as discussed in Section 3.1.
The frequency responses of the beam with a constrained 1-3
SVC layer under transverse point-load (p0 ¼1.5 N) and at different
control-gains (kd) are evaluated around the fundamental frequency
(xn). Similar responses for the beam with constrained monolithic
VEM are also evaluated. Fig. 5(a) and (b) illustrate the frequency
responses and corresponding variations of the control voltage of
the overall beam. It may be noticed from Fig. 5(a) and (b) that
attenuation increases with the control-gain (kd) while corresponding maximum control-voltage also increases. It may also be
observed that attenuation increases in case of the beam with a constrained 1-3 SVC layer as compared monolithic VEM layer. These
aforesaid results stipulate that the damping capacity may be
improved significantly using constrained 1-3 SVC in the place of
monolithic VEM.

4. Conclusion
A design of 1-3 SVC is proposed for the augmentation of damping in structural vibration. The 1-3 SVC is designed by inserting
active piezoelectric patches within the monolithic VEM layer. Both
UCLD/CLD treatment of beam with unconstrained/constrained 1-3
SVC is carried out. In order to evaluate the performance of the present 1-3 SVC layer, the optimal geometrical properties are decided
for the maximum attainable modal loss factor at different controlgains. It is observed that in the case of the beam with 1-3 SVC, the
modal loss factor and its extension and shear counterparts
increases simultaneously as compared to monolithic VEM layer.
It occurs mainly due to an increase in extensional/compression
and shear strains in VEM layer through the inserted active piezoelectric patches. It is also noticed that damping of the beam with
1-3 SVC increases with the control-gain while corresponding maximum control-voltage also increases. It is remarked that CLD treatment provides more damping compared to UCLD treatment. Hence
the aforesaid results reveal that the present 1-3 SVC may be a
potential damping layer in the UCLD/CLD treatment of structural
vibration.
