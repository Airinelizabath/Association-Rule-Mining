Abstract 
 Modal analysis comprises of determination of natural frequency, mode shapes and damping factor of dynamic structures. It 
is essential in analyzing the response of a structure in real-life situations to avoid resonance condition under excitation. Now a 
days, composites with natural fiber/particle materials are in considerable demand for structural applications as an alternative
material to conventional synthetic fiber composites. However, adequate amount of work on modal analysis of these composites 
has not been noticed in the literature. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the influence of coconut shell particle size 
and its volume fraction on natural frequencies and damping factor of coconut shell particles filled epoxy composites. Coconut 
shell particles reinforced composites (CSPE) were developed using open mould technique with particle sizes of 0.25, 0.5,1 and 2
mm and particle volume fractions of 40%, 50% and 60%. The experimental set up consists of a composite cantilever beam (270 
mm × 40 mm × 12 mm), impact hammer, accelerometer and computer interfaced data acquisition system. Acceleration v/s Time 
plots were acquired using LAB VIEW virtual instrumentation software and converted into Amplitude v/s Frequency plot by Fast 
Fourier Transform (FFT) using MAT LAB. The natural frequencies are also predicted theoretically and numerically (using 
ANSYS). The damping ratio was determined using half power band width method. The results reveal that as the particle size and 
its volume fraction increases, the natural frequency decreases whereas it is vice versa in case of damping factor. The 
experimental, theoretical and numerical values of natural frequencies are found to be in good agreement. It is concluded that 
CSPE composites possesses the damping ratios comparable to conventional composite materials such as glass fiber filled epoxy 
composites.

natural particles (bio based) in the place of synthetic materials are due to several advantages like low density, low 
scarcity of wood resources. Natural frequency and damping factor are the important modal parameters for the design 
of structures for which vibration control and cyclic loading are critical. All engineering materials dissipate energy 
under cyclic loading. Some of them, like elastomer, plastic, and rubber, dissipate more energy per cycle than 
metallic materials. The aforementioned modal parameters are affected by repeated corrosion, grain size, porosity, 
and fatigue, especially in metallic materials. Polymer matrix composites are commonly used in weight sensitive 
structures due to their high stiffness-to-weight ratio. They are especially significant in aircraft, aerospace, and 
military applications. The dynamic stability is an important design requirement in polymer matrix composite 
structures. Hence, natural frequency and damping properties must be investigated for possible use in various 
applications. Several studies have been carried out on the vibration properties of polymer matrix composite materials 
[1-6]. Mehmet1
 investigated the effect of temperature on vibration properties of polyethylene fiber composite 
(UHMW-PE UD-HB2) with different fiber orientations of 00
 and 900
. The frequency response was measured by 
using damping monitoring equipment. The obtained results of frequency response were compared with numerical 
results and are found to be in good agreement. It is observed that natural frequency decrease with the increasing 
temperature. Satish2
 has made an attempt to analyze the modal behavior of bi-woven (00
/900
) laminates made of 
Glass and Graphite fibers of different thicknesses of 2mm and 4mm reinforced with epoxy resin. Tests were carried 
out for different boundary conditions (cantilever, two sides fixed and all sides fixed) and analysis of the damping. 
Results revealed that both natural frequency and percent modal damping of graphite/epoxy laminate is more 
dominant than glass/epoxy laminates. Ravi3
 studied the effect of natural rubber particles addition on the vibration 
properties of epoxy (Lapox 12 with hardener K6) - filled glass fiber (5 mil plain mat) composite laminate in the ratio 
of 40:60 (fiber: resin) by wt%. Samples were prepared by adding 10 wt% natural rubber particles of distinct sizes 
(0.9, 0.45 0.254 and 0.0975 mm of approximately spherical shape). Tests were carried out to determine the damping 
properties of different samples. Results revealed that damping ratio increase with the addition of natural rubber 
particles. Composite with 0.254mm particles addition improved the damping property than other particle sizes 
without greatly affecting the stiffness property. Ray4 developed a polymer matrix composite with fly ash as filler for 
high damping characterization. The unsaturated polyester mixed with SBR latex particles in three different weight 
fractions was used as matrix system. Fly ash was used as filler with 40 and 50 wt% to develop the composites. 
Results revealed that composite with 5 wt% SBR latex and 50wt% fly ash exhibited high damping characteristic.
Aly5 studied the effect of fiber orientations on the vibration behavior of beams made of glass fiber (bidirectional 
fabric) reinforced polyester composites. Experimental tests were carried out using composite beams with distinct 
fiber orientations (00
, 150
, and 300
). From the results, it is observed that increasing the angle of the fibers from 00 to 
300
 reduces the frequency from 22 to 17 Hz (23%) in 1st mode and 146.5 to 121Hz (17.5%) in 2nd mode of vibration. 
The obtained results were compared with numerical results and found to be in good agreement. This study concludes 
that it may help the designer in selection of fiber orientation to shift the natural frequency to the desired value or to

 determined the damping properties of polymer matrix (glass fiber/epoxy) 
composites for various fiber volume fractions of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70% by analytical methods (Rule of 
mixtures, HASHIN Model, HALPIN TSAI Model), experimental, and semi-empirical method. For validation, 
experiments were carried out using universal testing machine to acquire the values of specific damping capacity. 
Finally, author has concluded that experimental method can be used successfully to measure the damping properties 
of composites. Also, semi-empirical approach that considers the experimental correlation factors is closer to reality. 
 From the review of literature, it can be seen that the study on vibration parameters of natural particle composites 
is scanty. Hence an attempt has been made to evaluate the natural frequencies and damping ratios of CSPE 
composites. 
2. Experimental 
2.1Material details 
 The materials used for fabrication of composites consists of fully dried coconut shell particles of distinct sizes 
viz., 0.25mm, 0.5mm, 1mm, and 2mm as reinforcement material. The epoxy resin LY556 and hardener HY951 in 
the ratio of 10:1 was used as matrix. 5% of melamine was also added into the matrix to have better surface finish of 
the developed composites. The materials were purchased from M/s Insulation house, Bangalore, India. 
2.2Fabrication of Composite 
 The CSPE composite beams (cantilever type) were fabricated with different particle volume fractions of 40%, 
50% and 60% using distinct particle sizes of 0.25mm, 0.5mm, 1mm, and 2mm by open mould process. Density is a 
fundamental physical property that can be used in conjunction with other properties for the characterization of 
composite. The densities of CSPE composite with different volume fractions were determined by the water 
displacement method according to the ASTM D 792-00. The densities of CSPE composites with particle volume 
fractions of 40%, 50% and 60% was found to have 933, 884 and 842 kg/m3
 respectively. It is observed that density 
of the composite decreases as the volume fraction of particle (coconut shell particle) increase in the composite. The 
reason may be due to the less density of particle than the matrix system. The details of fabricated composite beam 
samples are presented in Table 1. The elastic modulus required for the measurement of theoretical frequencies are 
also investigated by conducting the tensile test and presented in the same table (Table1). 
2.3 Measurement of natural frequency and damping ratio 
 An experimental set up developed for the measurement of natural frequency and damping ratio is shown in 
Figure 1. It consists of CSPE composite beam of size 300 mm × 50 mm × 12 mm. The beam was clamped over a 
length of 97 mm and the remaining cantilever portion of 203 mm was used for excitation. A piezo electric 
accelerometer was mounted at free end of the cantilever beam. Care has been taken to trace the antinodes for fixing 
the accelerometer at the free end. The accelerometer is connected to computer interfaced data acquisition system 
with LABVIEW virtual instrumentation software. The excitation of the test samples were induced using impulse 
hammer. The response from the accelerometer was then converted into electrical signals by the data acquisition 
system. Acceleration v/s Time plots were acquired and converted into Amplitude v/s Frequency plot by Fast Fourier 
Transform (FFT) using MAT LAB. The peaks in the frequency response spectrum are the locations of natural 
frequencies. The damping ratio was calculated by half-power bandwidth method [3] using the obtained frequency 
response functions using equation (1).

Where f1 and f2 are the frequencies corresponding to the bandwidth at a point 1/√2 times the maximum amplitude at 
resonant frequency. Three identical samples for each particle size and each particle volume fraction were tested to 
establish the uncertainty in the experimentation.

4. Numerical 
 The modal analysis of CSPE composite cantilever beams were carried out using ANSYS 14.0 finite element 
simulation tool. Linear elastic isotropic model was used for the investigation. Young’s modulus and density values 
of composite are essential for the analysis. BEAM 3 (Beam 2D elastic) element was used for the analysis that has 3 
degrees of freedom (translation along the X and Y axes, and rotation about the Z axis). Analysis was carried using 
subspace method which gives more accurate values of natural frequency and the obtained results are compared with 
the results of experimental and theoretical analysis.

5. Results and Discussion 
 The first two resonant frequencies of the composite beam samples observed from the experiments are presented in 
Table 2. The particle size and particle volume fraction have significant effect on resonant frequency. The resonant 
frequencies of CSPE composite beams showed decreasing trend with the increase in size of coconut shell particles 
(particle size) and particle volume fraction. Since beams were excited at lower frequencies, only first two resonant 
frequencies could be observed. The experimentally obtained results are compared with the analytical data that are 
calculated using Eq. (2) and numerical results. It is seen that the experimental results are in good agreement with both 
analytical and numerical results. The damping plays a major role at resonant frequencies and hence, damping ratios are 
also evaluated at resonant frequencies. The damping ratio ξ of the composite cantilever beam for resonant frequencies 
corresponding to first two modes of vibration are indicated in Table 3. It is observed from Table 3 that, damping ratio is 
higher for lower resonant frequency (I mode) and is lower for higher resonant frequency (II mode) in all the samples. 
Damping ratio of CSPE composites increased with the increase in particle particle size and particle volume fractions. 
The decrease in the resonant frequency and increase in the damping ratio with the increase in the particle particle size 
may be due to the reduction in stiffness of the composite at higher particle particle size. The stiffness of CSPE 
composites depends on the interfacial adhesive bonding area of particle particles, matrix-particle adhesion and particle 
packing factor. These influencing parameters decrease with the increase in the particle size.

 Typical frequency response curves for few of the CSPE composite samples (A1, A2, A3 and D3) obtained 
experimentally by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using MAT LAB are shown in Figures 2 (a), 2 (b), 2(c) and 2(d) 
respectively. The maximum value of natural frequency that occurs at 40% particle volume fraction and 0.25 mm

particle particle size is 53.21 Hz at the first mode and 345.45 Hz at the second mode of vibration (Fig.2(a)). The 
lowest value of natural frequency that occurs for 60% particle volume fraction and 2 mm particle particle size is 
47.23 Hz at the first mode of vibration Fig.2 (d). Whereas the damping ratio of sample A1(40% particle volume 
fraction and 0.25mm particle size) showed lowest value of 0.0204 and sample D3 (60% particle volume fraction and 
2 mm particle size) revealed the highest value of 0.084 in first mode of vibration. The inverse relationship between 
natural frequency and damping ratio of series A CSPE composite samples is presented in Figure 3. Similar trend 
was observed for other series of CSPE composite samples. The CSPE composite possesses greater values of 
damping ratios compared to Multiwall Carbon Nanotube reinforced aluminium-silicon alloy composites [7] and 
almost comparable to Jute Nano Fibre Reinforced Composites [8].

results were compared with theoretical and numerical results and are found to be in good agreement. Both particle 
volume fraction and particle particle size have considerable effect on the vibration parameters. CSPE Composites 
with 0.25 mm particle size and 40% particle volume fraction( Sample A1) exhibited higher natural frequency and 
lower damping ratio whereas the CSPE composite with 2 mm particle size and 60% particle volume fraction 
(Sample D3) showed lower natural frequency and higher damping ratio. Based on the comparison of damping 
factor made with other types of composites from literature, CSPE composite can be recommended as a suitable 
damping material for applications in automobile sectors and interiors in aerospace applications.
