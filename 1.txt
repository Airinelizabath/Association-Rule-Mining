Abstract
Estimating damping in structure composed of different materials (steel, brass, aluminum) and processes still remains as one of the 
most extremely vast challengers. The paper presents Structural damping effect on beam vibration by impact hammer. Structural 
damping contributes to about 10-15% of total system damping. The main objective of this work is to estimate the natural frequency 
and damping ratio of cantilever beams of Aluminum, Brass, and Steel by LabVIEW software and validate the result with vibration 
analysis and Harmonic analysis utilizing ANSYS. Free vibration analysis was carried out for identifying the natural frequencies
and the harmonic analysis was carried out for obtaining frequency replication curves from which damping ratios were estimated 
utilizing Half- power Band Width Method. It is observed that damping ratio is higher for brass than steel than aluminum.

1. Introduction
The concept of damping within a structural system can have different meanings to the various trade branches. Damping 
is one of many different methods that have been proposed for allowing a structure to achieve optimal performance 
when it is subjected to seismic, wind storm or other types of transient shock and vibration disturbances. [5] Vibration 
is an element which is hard to avoid in practice. Excitation of resonant frequencies of some structural parts can occur 
with existence of vibration even it is only a small insignificant vibration. The number of times that a complete motion 
takes place during the period of one second is called frequency which is measured in Hertz (Hz).[10] Dynamic analysis 
aims at understanding, evaluating and modifying the structural dynamic behaviour which involves many terms such 
as natural frequencies, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, damping ratios, Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) etc. Modal 
analysis is an effective means for identifying, accepting and simulating dynamic behaviour and responses of structural 
elements. Modal analysis using ANSYS is an effective method of determining vibration characteristics [14]. Material

damping of cantilever beams attracts a lot of work even though extensive literature exists in the area of vibrations of
beams. Material damping has not been paid much attention [14]. In this paper the cantilever beam structure, as shown 
in Fig. 2, has been taken as a part because of its ease of practical ableness and also the ability to exemplify a variety 
of mechanical products such as wing of an aircraft, rotor blade of a helicopter, blade of a ceiling fan, needle of a clock, 
shelve of a civil structure, solar panel of a satellite etc. The dimensions of the cantilever beam structure are 370 x 25 
x 10 mm, having a material of MS, Aluminium and Brass. The main aim of this project is to investigate highly damped 
structural material out of various materials of structural beams from finding damping ratio by half-power bandwidth 
method to reduce vibration level of the system for increase accuracy, safety and machine life.

2. Damping
Damping is the phenomenon by which mechanical energy is dissipated (usually converted into internal thermal 
energy) in dynamic systems. A knowledge of the level of damping in a dynamic system is important in utilization, 
analysis, and testing of the system. Damping is the energy dissipation of a material or system under cyclic stress. 
Several types of damping are inherently present in a mechanical system.
They are: 1. Internal (material) damping 2. Structural damping 3. . Fluid damping
Internal (material) damping results from mechanical-energy dissipation within the material due to various 
microscopic and macroscopic processes. Structural damping is caused by mechanical energy dissipation resulting 
from relative motions between components in a mechanical structure that has common points of contact, joints, or 
supports. Fluid damping arises from the mechanical energy dissipation resulting from drag forces and associated 
dynamic interactions when a mechanical system or its components move in a fluid
3. Measurement of damping
Damping can be represented by various parameters (such as specific damping capacity, loss factor, Q-factor, and 
damping ratio) and models (such as viscous, hysteretic, structural, and fluid). Before attempting to measure damping 
in a system, one should decide on a representation (model) that will adequately characterize the nature of 
mechanical-energy dissipation in the system. There are two general ways by which damping measurements can be 
made: time-response methods and frequency-response methods. The basic difference between the two types of 
measurements is that the first type uses a time-response record of the system to estimate damping, whereas the 
second type uses a frequency-response record
4. Half-power bandwidth method
This method is also based in the magnitude curve of the frequency-response function. Bandwidth (Δω) is defined as 
the width of the frequency response magnitude curve when the magnitude is ͳ
ξʹ ൗ times the peak value. Then, 
damping ratio can be determined from bandwidth using the expression

5. Experimental setup of cantilever beam
An experimental setup shown in fig. First a beam of various material is to be fix at one end. An Accelerometer has 
been attached to the cantilever beam at free end to sense the acceleration data of vibration. Impact hammer is use to 
disturb the frequency or to oscillate the beam. After impact the beam will be oscillate, so accelerometer sense data 
and signal generated by DAQ device. LabVIEW software used to analysis the signals on laptop. 
Fig. 2. Experimental setup of cantilever beam
To calculate the natural frequency of the cantilever beam experimentally, experiment is conducted the with the 
specified cantilever beam specimen to record the data of time history (Acceleration-Time), and FFT plot. The 
natural frequencies of the system can be obtained directly by observing the FFT plot. The location of peak values 
corresponds to the natural frequencies of the system.

6. Result and discussion
The Damping ratio is a parameter, usually denoted by ζ (zeta) provides a mathematical means of expressing the 
level of damping in a system relative to critical damping. Damping of specimens made up of different materials 
(brass, aluminium and mild steel) was calculated with the help of half power bandwidth method.

7. Conclusion
The comparison concludes that the theoretical calculations based on the Harmonic Analysis with Ansys match with 
experiments very well for the structural Beam with maximum errors of 14%.The Harmonic analysis has effective, 
positive and helpful method for estimating of damping characteristic of structural beam. From the fig it concludes that 
when Density of material increases, Damping Ratio also increases and Natural Frequency decreases of respective 
material density. It also conclude that the Damping ratio of Brass material is higher than Aluminium. 
In the future this experiment can be applied for Nano level as well as composite material.
