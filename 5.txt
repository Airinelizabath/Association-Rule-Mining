Abstract.Vibration control of mechanical systems divided into two types active and passive, this 
case study illustrates other approach of passive control of the cantilever plate by using double 
layers of the viscoelastic material (Dyad 606) one in the upper face of the Al substrate (5051) and
the second one in the lower face. This layers are affected by axial uniform distributed force by 
applying tension load, the damping level depend on the value of this axial force where the vertical 
component of this force consistently the other way of the vibrating element that reduce vibration 
amplitude in this direction by about (95%) of the original amplitude without damping layers.
Computational analysis using ANSYS program are used firstly to verify that the results from the 
software are compatible with that obtained from analytical and experimental evaluation by 
comparing the values of natural frequencies. Then using ANSYS model to calculate the reduction 
occurs in the lateral vibration with changing of the axial loads on the viscoelastic plates. The 
benefits of this model are enhancing the reliability and reducing the cost. 
1. Introduction
Various techniques are used in damping process of the undesirable vibrations that may cause damaging of 
the structures and machines. Damping systems are divided into two main types active and passive [1], at 
the first, active vibration control uses many kinds of sensors and actuators to generate forces in the right 
direction and time to sustain the unwanted frequencies that cause vibration[2], this type of vibration 
control have higher cost and low reliability[3]. On the other hand, passive vibration control doesn’t use 
any sensor or actuator that require external power units and depend only on the damping properties of the 
used material[4].
There are two main types of passive damping, the first one is unconstrained layer damping (UCLD)[5] by 
adding a completely bonded damping layer on the surface of the vibrating structure,as shown in figure 1
but this method cannot be used in many mechanical structures due to lower damping ratios[6].The second 
type In 1959, Kerwin, et al [7] first did a fundamental work in what is called passive constrained layer 
damping (PCLD), where the damping layer putted in between of the base material layer and constrained

layer that may be made of the same material of the base layer or different material as shown in figure2This 
type of damping reduces the efficiency of the system and increasing the net cost[8].
In our work we study other approach of damping system that used two layers of damping material one of 
them on the upper surface of the base vibrating element and the second one on the lower side to achieve 
higher damping characteristic, low cost, simplicity and enhanced reliability[9]

- Conventional materials (that having low loss factor).
- Composite materials, which exhibited higher viscoelastic properties than conventional materials 
and having superior specific stiffness and strength[11].
- Viscoelastic materials, for which the correlation between stress and strain depend on time so that 
the behavior of this type of material depend on the loading history and that have highest loss 
factor comparing with the composite materials[12].
In our damping system we use viscoelastic material type (Dayd 606) in both damping layers
2. Calculating of natural frequency 
The natural frequency is the frequency at which a system tends to oscillate in the absence of any driving or 
damping force. when an object vibrates at frequency equivalents s to natural frequency, its vibration 
amplitude increases significantly which could lead to irreparable damage. Determination of natural 
frequency could be estimated with several methods.
2.1.Numerical invistagation
The process of developing the finite element model starts in the "Engineering Data section" in ANSYS 
workbench package version R15.0 [14], by assigning the mechanical properties of all materials used in 
building the FEM, The materials used are discussed in details in the next section.

2.1.2. Meshing of the plate FEM .Meshing process is started by applying mesh tool to the developed 3-D
model using fine mesh. The number of elements is decided after a convergence study made for the 
ANSYS model using mesh sensitivity analysis. The convergence isobtained at 5 mm element size.
The element type is "solid 186" – 20 node homogenous structural solid, figure 3 shows the solid 186 
element configuration. It is a higher order 3-D 20-node solid element that exhibits quadratic displacement 
behavior. The element is defined by 20 nodes having three degrees of freedom per node: translations in 
the nodal x, y, and z directions. The element supports plasticity, hyper elasticity, creep, stress stiffening, 
large deflection, and large strain capabilities[15]. The geometry, node locations, and the element 
coordinate system for this element are shown in figure 4

2.1.3.Static analysis. Static structural analysis tool is performed to apply the steady inertia loads such as 
plate gravity, and used to determine the plate displacements, stresses, strains, etc… a cantilever boundary 
conditions are applied to the FE model. Figure5Shows the plate tip displacement due to gravitational load
Figure. 5 The plate tip displacement due to gravitational load.
2.1.4.Modal analysis
Modal analysis is used to determine the vibration characteristics (natural frequencies and mode shapes) of 
the cantilever plate and the plate with polymer. It considered as a starting point for more detailed dynamic 
analysis, such as transient dynamic analysis, harmonic response analysis, or spectral analysis. 
When frequencies of dynamic load match one of natural frequencies, then resonance takes place, which is 
considered from the main critical parameter of dynamic structure design. Mode shapes hereinafter called 
modes, and natural frequencies (NF) of the plate and the plate with polymer are obtained by modal 
analysis tool. The plate and the plate with polymer mode shape are shown in figures 6, 7, 8, 9. The values 
of natural frequencies of the plain plate and the plate with polymer layers are tabulated in Table.3

2.2. Experimentalinvestigations
The experimental verification of finite element analysis is conducted. The experimental system layout is 
shown in figure 10. In this experiment, the plate is clamped from one end onto a shaker 4808 with fixation 
support, and the second end is free. 
Two accelerometers type PCB PIEZOTRONICS are attached to the plate by a suitable adhesive, one is 
fixed on the plate free end to measure the output response, and the other is fixed on the shaker fixation 
support to measure the input excitation. The shaker B&k type 4808is driven by power amplifier B&k type 
2712, which amplifies the sine sweep, signal (0-200) Hz coming from waveform generator. Chasses of NI 
compact DAQ-9188 is used for data acquisition system and PC with Lab Viewprogram is used to acquire 
and analyze the data. The most suitable technique used for characterizing the plate material properties in 
the frequency range (from 1 up to 1000 Hz) is the frequency response technique[13]. FRF results are 
processed by comparing the measured acceleration values taken by the accelerometer mounted on the 
plate free end (output) with the measured acceleration results taken from the accelerometer mounted on 
the shaker support (input). To obtain exact experimental results, ten repeated measurements are recorded 
for each experimental set up and the average values are considered as shown in figure 11.

3. Finite element modeling verification
The theoretical results are used to verify the FE model by conducting a comparison between the plainplate
and the plate with polymer numericallyand experimentally. The comparison between the resonant 
frequencies of the numerical simulation and the experimental result are shown in table 4.
The results are in good agreement with an 4 % maximum error. The contrast among FE and exploratory 
outcomes can be credited to the accompanying:
 Distinction in material properties among FE and actual plate.
 Difference in boundary conditions; in FE model, the end is fixed, where in testing it is clamped 
and there may be still some relative freedom. 
 -Difference in the portrayal of the accelerometer; in FE model, it is a concentrated mass, where in 
testing it is stuck to the plate. 
 -Effect of environmental conditions during tests (temperature...etc.), which are not accounted for 
in simulation. 
 In the FE model, just the shaker impact is signified (the environmental vibrations are not 
represented).

4.Casestudy
The main purpose of this technique is to illustrate numerically the fundamentals associated with damping
the vibration of plate using a new method of passive control layer damping treatment. The developed new 
model is based on the idea of generating uniformly distributed forces on two layers of the damping 
materialexperiencing cyclic motionis shown in figure 12. The lateral components of the exerting forces 
always affecting in direction opposing the angle of rotation of plate. These lateral components have a 
complex form due to the inherent damping of the elastic layer bonded to the structure fibers. It will be 
demonstratednumerically that a more than 95% reduction in the peak of the fundamental bending mode of 
a cantilevered plate can be obtained by virtue of this new technique.

4.1 Harmonic response analysis
A harmonic response tool is applied to study the plate FRF for the first two bending modes. It is carried 
out for the plate with /without the damping material. A transverse excitation force of 1 N with sine sweep 
signal varies from 0 to 200 Hz is applied at the plate structure. FRF of a structure otherwise called a 
transfer function is a ratio of the output signal to the input signal in frequency domain. Figure13 shows 
the amplitude of the plain plate and plate with polymer at different resonant frequencies or called 
amplitude FRF of the plate and the plate with polymer, hereinafter called the plate and the plate with 
polymer FRF.

6. Conclusion
A new passive control model used for suppression of the lateral vibrations of a flexible base excited 
cantilevered Plate is illustrated in the present paper, This new approach, which is called pre-tensioned 
layer damping (PTLD), is a sort of artificial damping techniques, which is based on the theory of energy 
dissipation from vibrating systems. The devolved model has a simple, reliable and inexpensive solution

for the Plate /PTLD system. At which the major advance in the attenuation of the vibration amplitude has 
been discussed. the damping ratio is enhanced without the usage of complications control devices that 
used in case of Active Constrain Layer Damping (ACLD) It is noticed that the higher the elastic 
Pretensionforces in the pre-tensioned layer damping material that increase the attenuation percentage and 
the damping efficiency.
